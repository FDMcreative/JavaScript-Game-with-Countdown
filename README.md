# JavaScript-Game-with-Countdown
### *a small javascript math game with a countdown*
-

This small javasctipt project prompts the user with a math question and upon correct answer it shows another one, ad libitum.
In case of correct answer 1 point is given, otherwise 1 point is subtracked.
If the 10 seconds timer runs out, the game is over.

The functionalities are: a countdown timer, a random addition question with numbers between 1 and 101, an input field and a submit button, possibility of submitting with enter key, automatic focus on input field to increase input speed and user experience.

-

Difficulties:

- After a correct answer has been entered, make the timer resets correctly (start again from 10 AND close the precedent countdown to avoid overlaps).
